                    <h1>Responsive Webpages</h1>
                    <p>Responsive Webpages are one of the most influencial and one of the easiest items a web developer can control. The majority of web users use mobile to access the web, therefore, a website <span class="sUnderline">NEEDS</span> to be responsive.</p>
                    <div class="contentBoxImgContainer">

                    <h2>How did they do?</h2>
                    <p>The image above is from <a href="https://www.pottersbakery.com.">Potter's Bakery</a>. Their website on a desktop screen looks fairly good, however, when you switch to a mobile perspective, it becomes unuasble. If I am a mobile user and see this page, why go through the trouble of trying to find my way through this page when I can find another bakery somewhere else with a better viewing experience? Beyond that, Google is going to index rank this website worse than someone who <span class="sUnderline">DOES</span> focus on responsive webpages. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="contentBox">
                    <h1>404 Error Pages</h1>
                    <p>404 Error Pages can be overlooked pretty easily because as long as the user follows your site as you intend, nothing bad should happen, right? There is always ways a user will use the website other than intended, or there could even be a issue that wasn't identified. Nonethless, having a custom 404 error page will let the user know something bad happen, and allows you to guide their next step.</p>

                    <p>The photo above is from <a href="https://www.endorphinfitness.com/adf">Endorphin Fitness</a>. They do a awesome job with their custom 404 error page. They let the user know something happened, however, they have a search bar and the nav bar present to allow the user to get back on track. This allows for the opportunity for the user to stay on the site for a longer period of time.</p>

                <div class="contentBox">
                    <h1>Robots.txt</h1>
                    <p>A robots.txt file is a file that only web crawlers will view. A normal user will likely never encounter this file. This file tells the crawlers which parts of the site <span class="sUnderline">NOT</span> to index. This is useful for not allowing an admin login or a cart link from being a option (index) to choose from when using a search engine.</p>
                    <div class="contentBoxImgContainer">

                    <p>The photo above is from <a href="https://www.sportclips.com/robots.txt">SportClips</a>. SportClips does a good job telling <span class="sUnderline">ALL</span> search engine crawlers not to index certain items, such as their checkout or admin login pages. Furthermore, they also link their sitemap.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="contentBox">
                    <h1>Sitemap for Crawlers (XML)</h1>
                    <p>A Sitemap for Crawlers can be extremely useful when a website is large and complex in size. For example, a hobbyist's website may not want to look in sitemaps, however, companies like Planet Fitness would want to look into creating one. This sitemap allows crawlers to better understand your site, such as the relationship between pages, and where certain information is. Alongside that, crawlers work more efficiently when there is a sitemap.</p>

                    <p>The photo above is from <a href="https://millinn.com/sitemap_index.xml">Mill Inn</a>. While the Mill Inn is not a complicated website, they provided a sitemap, so, crawlers will work more efficiently. They used a site to auto generate this file, and properly lays out the information that would be needed for crawlers. Overall, they seem to created a valid sitemap for crawlers</p>

                <div class="contentBox">
                    <h1>Page Load Speed</h1>
                    <p>If a page loads fast, a user will see it faster and be less inclined to go somewhere else. If a user has to sit on a loading page screen for even a 5 seconds or more, there is a high probability they will leave and look somewhere else. A page that loads fast will not only retain these users, but rank better in search engine ranks.</p>
                    <div class="contentBoxImgContainer">

These page is a work in-progress, however, the images and page load within a 1-2 seconds after going to their site. This means the page loads relatively fast. There could be some work done for some photos as they loaded slower then others, however, its good overall.</p>

                <div class="contentBox">
                    <h1>Page Titles</h1>
                    <p>Page titles are simple, but yet the most important thing when a visitor uses a search engine. Not only will it be the first impression on the user, it also needs to cater towards the users needs.</p>
                    <div class="contentBoxImgContainer">
                        <img src="images/page-titles.png" alt="Example of a page showing good use of page titles">

                    <h2>How did they do?</h2>
                    <p>The photo above is from <a href="https://tpalmer3.ninetyfive.dev/CIS295/salon-site">Hairway to Heaven</a>. Their site is still in a work in-progress stage, however, their title is extremely simple, but yet gets the message accross of what their website is, and who it caters towards. The only thing they should change is the business name should be last.</p>
